"# PCC-benchmark-for-Global-Optimal-Algorithms" 

PCC benchmark is a new proposed test set especially for optimization problems in the field of nonlinear cruve fitting.

There are totally 38 problems in PCC benchmark, which can be found in "PCC Benchmark" directory under this repository

All the problems in PCC benchmark have the features of small-scale and high level of difficulty.

Therefore, it's a great benchmark to test your global optimization algorithms(GOA) efficiently because of these features.

It's should be noted that all problems here have free searching domain.

Moreover, since every problem presented in this benchmark is considerably difficult, it's impossible to prove that the best optimal solution obtained so far is theoretically correct.

As a result, the best optimal solution obtained so far will be considered as the global optimal solution.
